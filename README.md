# Exam Attendance & Seating System-DSA project

A C++ console application using **Stack data structure** to manage student attendance and generate exam seating arrangements.

## Features
- Add students to attendance list
- Mark students as present/absent
- Remove last added student (Stack LIFO)
- Display complete attendance list
- Generate exam seating arrangement in rows/columns

## Data Structure Used
**Stack (Linked List Implementation)**
- LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Pointer-based traversal

## Technologies
- C++
- Data Structures (Stack using Linked List)
- Pointers & Dynamic Memory

## How to Run
```bash
# Compile
g++ main.cpp -o attendance

# Run
./attendance
```

## Menu Options
1. Add a student
2. Mark attendance  
3. Remove last added student
4. Show attendance list
5. Arrange exam seats
6. Exit

## Sample Output
```
===== Exam Attendance & Seating System =====
Enter roll number: 101
Enter student name: Ali
Student added successfully.
```
